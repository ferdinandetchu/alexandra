        This is a Polish language resource put together by an english speaking
        South African, living in Poland, who has been studying Polish with a
        qualified teacher for two years. Hello, my name is Alex, welcome to my
        resource for Polish Language Learners.<br></br> Using a combination of
        pattern recognition, association and iconisation, this resource offers
        you a very realistic opportunity to become an effective and successful
        Polish Language Student.<br></br> By going through the interactive
        activities, your ability to retain new vocabulary and concepts, will
        increase. With increased retention, learning becomes self-motivated:
        simply because your reward is remembering and implementing new concepts
        and vocabulary.<br></br>
